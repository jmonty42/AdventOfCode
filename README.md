# Advent of Code

I got invited by a former coworker to participate in [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). This repo contains the code I used to solve the puzzles. The point of the exercise is to do it as quickly as possible, so the solutions are going to be quick and dirty.

The organization may seem inefficient since it looks like each solution script lives in its own folder for each day's challenge. That's because I use the folders to also hold examples and my input from the challenge, neither of which are allowed to be published, hence their entries in the `.gitignore` file.

I may go back and write solutions for previous years at some point.
